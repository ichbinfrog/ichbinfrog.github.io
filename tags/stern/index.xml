      <description>Having a good log and monitoring infrastructure becomes a key feature that allows sysadmins, support teams, and even developers to be more prepared to face these possible operational problems and address problems in the code base more efficiently.

As such, it is the fundamental building block of application monitoring allowing for an objective overview of the health of the given system.</description>
